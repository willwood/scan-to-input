# Scan-To-Input

**Scan-To-Input** is a lightweight JavaScript plugin that detects input from most _plug-and-play_ USB and Bluetooth hardware barcode or QR code scanners ‚Äî which emulate keyboard input ‚Äî and intelligently captures the scanned data into specified HTML form fields.

In other words, it captures a scanned QR or barcode, and passes the value into an HTML `<input>` form element.

It is designed to be simple, extensible, and integration-friendly, making it ideal for a wide range of projects including inventory management, eCommerce systems, research tools, and scientific data collection platforms, like [EnvLog](https://github.com/willwood/EnvLog).

## Why This Plugin?

Most barcode and QR code scanners behave like **keyboard input devices**: they "type" the scanned data into whatever field is focused, usually at very high speed. This presents a challenge:

- The web browser can‚Äôt distinguish between fast keystrokes from a **scanner** and a fast typist.
- There‚Äôs often **no physical button press** to initiate or end a scan.
- Default behaviour may lead to scanned data being inserted into the wrong field or interfering with user interaction.

Scan-To-Input solves this by detecting:

- **Rapid keystroke sequences**
- **Alphanumeric patterns typical of barcodes**
- And intelligently **redirecting the scanned value** into a defined set of form fields.

## Features

- üß© Detects scanner-like input automatically (no need for hardware integration)
- üîÑ Configurable input targeting: overwrite a single field or fill successive empty inputs
- üßº Includes optional **clear buttons** next to inputs
- üîí Supports custom REGEX **validation logic** (e.g. barcode format checks)
- üì¶ Zero dependencies ‚Äî no jQuery or frameworks required
- üß™ Extendable via callback hooks (`onScan`)
- üéØ Optimised for Bootstrap styling but CSS-agnostic

## Scanner Compatibility

Scan-To-Input is designed to work with **most USB and Bluetooth barcode or QR code scanners** that emulate keyboard input ‚Äî which is the default mode for the vast majority of modern scanners.

The Inateck BCST-23 has proven reliable for scanning both **standard barcodes** (EAN-13, UPC-A, Code 128, etc.) and **2D QR codes** on macOS Sequoia (14.x) and Linux Mint 22.1, in both USB and Bluetooth (BLE/SPP) modes.

Because Scan-To-Input listens for **keyboard-like character input patterns**, it does not need to communicate directly with scanner hardware. This means:

- No drivers or special libraries required.
- Works on virtually any OS (Windows, macOS, Android, Linux, ChromeOS).
- Compatible with browsers that support standard DOM events (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

As long as the scanner:

- Emulates keyboard input (also known as HID mode)
- Outputs plain alphanumeric characters

‚Ä¶it should work out of the box.

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations to be aware of...

- Some **basic 1D barcode scanners** do not support QR codes or Data Matrix formats. These typically work only with traditional barcodes (e.g. UPC, EAN).
- Scanners configured to use **serial (COM) mode** instead of HID/keyboard mode will not be compatible without additional drivers or bridging software.
- Certain mobile scanners or camera-based scanning libraries (e.g. using `getUserMedia`) are not currently supported, as they do not emit keystrokes.

---

To ensure best results:

- Configure your scanner to **append an Enter or Tab** character after each scan if supported (optional but helpful).
- Avoid browser input fields that may be auto-focussed or auto-corrected ‚Äî these can interfere with raw input capture.
- On macOS, ensure the scanner is paired in **keyboard mode**, not serial or ‚Äúother device‚Äù mode.

If your scanner isn't working, try testing it in a plain text editor. If it "types" the barcode characters rapidly into the document, it should be compatible with this plugin.

## Demos

You‚Äôll find working examples in the `/docs/` folder. These are designed to demonstrate real-world use cases using basic HTML and Bootstrap 5 styling.

You will need a USB or Bluetooth barcode scanner to test these examples.

## Installation

Simply include the script in your page:

```html
<script src="scan-to-input.js"></script>
```

Then initialise the scanner detection:

```html
<script>
  const scanner = new ScanDetect({
    mode: 'append',
    onScan: (value, input) => {
      console.log('Scanned:', value);
    },
    validation: (code) => /^[A-Z0-9\-]{4,}$/.test(code),
  });
</script>
```

Give an HTML input box a `data` attribute of `data-scan-box` and optionally include a cancel button with an attribute of `data-scan-remove` to reset the input box:

```html
<div class="position-relative mb-3">
  <input type="text" class="form-control rounded-end" data-scan-box />
  <button
    type="button"
    class="btn btn-link text-decoration-none"
    data-scan-remove
  >
    &times;
  </button>
</div>
```
